### Hello!

Nice to meet you, my name is Tulio. I really enjoy solving problems or trying to, that's why I have a Mathematics degree. Here are my projects, I hope you like them and maybe you'll see something that interests you.

### Algorithmic trading system

I made an algorithmic trading pipeline for cryptocurrency. The system is capable of training itself with new information and choose the best model for that purpose (between models XGBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVC with different parametrizations). Storage of the training dataset and the ongoing model execution information (open and closed orders and current prices) can be done both in an SQL database or csv files. The project's repository where you can find all the details is this one --> https://github.com/tulio311/AlgoTrading

### Data-ish

In this repository you'll find some projects related to data (Data analysis, Data science, Natural Language Processing and Statistics). The project's repository is this one --> https://github.com/tulio311/Data-ish

### Implementation of John Conway's Game of Life

John Conway created the rules for a now very famous automatic game related to cells represented as dots (or squares). This game creates the feeling of a live system and changes depending of the initial configuration of the screen. You can play it and review the rules here: https://conwaylife.com/. I implemented this game in a console application using C. You have two options in this implementation, use a randomly generated initial configuration, or create your own configuration in a `.txt` file using asterisks as the live cells. The project's repository is this one --> https://github.com/tulio311/ConwaysGameOfLife

You can review some other projects I've done in the pinned tags down here or in the repositories tab. This projects include Web Development, Data Structures, Graph algorithms, an encryption algorithm (RSA) and Web Scraping. 

Hope you enjoy your time here!
