### Hello!

Nice to meet you, my name is Tulio. I really enjoy solving problems or at least giving the best I have to solve them, that's the reason I studied a Mathematics degree. Here are my projects, I hope you like them and maybe you'll see something that is interesting for you. Hope you enjoy your time here!

### Algorithmic trading system

I made an algorithmic trading pipeline for cryptocurrency. The system is capable of training itself with new information and choose the best model for that purpose (between models XGBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVC with different parametrizations). Storage of the training dataset and the ongoing model execution information (open and closed orders and current prices) can be done both in an SQL database or csv files. The project's repository where you can find all the details is this one --> https://github.com/tulio311/AlgoTrading

Technologies used: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), SQL, Javascript (Node.js)

### Your click matters

This is a web page built in Flask that has 4 color boxes in the main page, each one with a word randomly chosen in each refresh from a determined set of words. Each click that you make in a box is sent to the server and the color and word of the click are saved in the database. There is another page in the web which has the statistics regarding to the total amount of clicks made in the page, by color and by word. The project's repository where you can find all the details is this one --> https://github.com/tulio311/YourClickMatters

Technologies used: Python (Flask), SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript (JQuery)

### Data-ish

In this repository you'll find some other projects related to data (Data analysis, Data science, Natural Language Processing and Statistics). The project's repository is this one --> https://github.com/tulio311/Data-ish

### Implementation of John Conway's Game of Life

John Conway created the rules for a now very famous automatic game related to cells represented as dots (or squares). This game creates the feeling of a live system and changes depending of the initial configuration of the screen. You can play it and review the rules here: https://conwaylife.com/. I implemented this game in a console application using C. You have two options in this implementation, use a randomly generated initial configuration, or create your own configuration in a `.txt` file using asterisks as the live cells. The project's repository is this one --> https://github.com/tulio311/ConwaysGameOfLife

Technologies used: C

You can review the rest of my projects in the pinned tags down here or in the repositories tab. This projects include Web Development, Data Structures, chatting with an LLM through an API for getting help with my projects, Graph algorithms, an encryption algorithm (RSA) and Web Scraping.
